#Code usage: The HTML and CSS framework was developed using examples and structures from W3Schools (2025).

#Images and style: The product layout and homepage design were inspired by Pinterest boards featuring fashion e-commerce UI trends (Pinterest, 2025).

#Colour palette: The chosen pink (#ff4081) and gold (#FFD700) accents were sourced using Adobe Color to maintain a modern, elegant brand tone (Adobe Color, 2025; Smith, 2023).

#Typography: Poppins was selected for a clean, modern look (Google Fonts, 2025), while Aptos was tested for potential body text due to its versatility (Microsoft, 2023).

#Design principles: The overall navigation and UX layout followed best practices outlined by Nielsen Norman Group (2024) and usability principles by Krug (2014).
